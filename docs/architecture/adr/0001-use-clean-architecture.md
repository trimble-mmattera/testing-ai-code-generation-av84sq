# ADR 0001: Use Clean Architecture

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The Document Management Platform requires a maintainable, testable, and scalable architecture that clearly separates business logic from external concerns. The technical specifications explicitly require following Clean Architecture and Domain-Driven Design principles. The platform needs to support multiple storage backends, search mechanisms, and delivery methods while maintaining a consistent core business logic.

## Decision

We will implement the Document Management Platform using Clean Architecture principles as defined by Robert C. Martin. This architecture organizes the system into concentric layers, with domain entities and business rules at the center, surrounded by use cases, interface adapters, and frameworks/drivers. Each microservice in our system will internally follow Clean Architecture principles.

## Architecture Layers

The system will be organized into the following layers:

### Domain Layer

Contains enterprise business rules, entities, and core domain models. This layer has no dependencies on other layers or external frameworks. It includes:
- Domain entities (Document, Folder, User, etc.)
- Domain interfaces (repositories, services)
- Value objects and domain events
- Domain exceptions and validation rules

### Application Layer

Contains application-specific business rules and use cases. It orchestrates the flow of data to and from domain entities and directs them to perform their business rules. It includes:
- Use cases (DocumentUseCase, FolderUseCase, etc.)
- DTOs for use case input/output
- Application services
- Application exceptions

### Infrastructure Layer

Contains implementations of the interfaces defined in the domain layer. It includes:
- Repository implementations (PostgreSQL, S3)
- External service integrations (virus scanning, search)
- Framework-specific code
- Data persistence mechanisms

### API Layer

Contains delivery mechanisms for the application. It includes:
- API controllers/handlers
- Request/response DTOs
- Validation
- Authentication/authorization middleware
- API documentation

## Dependency Rule

The fundamental rule of Clean Architecture is that dependencies can only point inward. Inner layers must not know about outer layers. This means:

1. Domain layer has no dependencies on other layers
2. Application layer depends only on the domain layer
3. Infrastructure layer depends on domain and application layers
4. API layer depends on application and domain layers

To achieve this, we will use dependency inversion through interfaces defined in the inner layers and implemented in the outer layers.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Independent of frameworks - The architecture doesn't depend on the existence of some library or tool
- Testable - Business rules can be tested without UI, database, web server, or any external element
- Independent of UI - The UI can change easily without changing the rest of the system
- Independent of database - Business rules are not bound to a specific database implementation
- Independent of any external agency - Business rules don't know anything about the outside world
- Clear separation of concerns - Each layer has a specific responsibility
- Easier to maintain and evolve - Changes in one layer don't affect other layers if interfaces remain stable

### Negative

- Increased complexity - More layers and interfaces can make the system harder to understand initially
- More code - Requires additional interfaces and abstractions
- Potential performance overhead - Due to additional layers of abstraction
- Learning curve - Developers need to understand and follow Clean Architecture principles
- Requires discipline - Team must adhere to the dependency rule consistently

## Implementation

The implementation will follow these guidelines:

### Project Structure

```
/src/backend
  /domain
    /models       # Domain entities
    /repositories # Repository interfaces
    /services     # Domain service interfaces
  /application
    /usecases     # Use case implementations
    /dtos         # Data transfer objects
  /infrastructure
    /persistence  # Repository implementations
    /storage      # S3 storage implementation
    /search       # Search implementation
    /auth         # Authentication implementation
    /virus_scanning # Virus scanning implementation
  /api
    /handlers     # API handlers
    /middleware   # API middleware
    /dto          # Request/response DTOs
    /validators   # Request validation
  /pkg
    /errors       # Error handling
    /logger       # Logging
    /config       # Configuration
    /utils        # Utilities
```

### Dependency Injection

We will use constructor injection to provide dependencies to components. This makes dependencies explicit and facilitates testing. Each component will declare its dependencies through its constructor, and the main application will wire everything together.

### Error Handling

Domain and application errors will be defined in their respective layers. Infrastructure and API layers will translate these errors to appropriate technical representations (e.g., HTTP status codes, database errors).

### Testing Strategy

- Domain layer: Unit tests with no external dependencies
- Application layer: Unit tests with mocked repositories and services
- Infrastructure layer: Integration tests with test databases and mocked external services
- API layer: Integration tests with mocked use cases and end-to-end tests

## Alternatives Considered

### Traditional Layered Architecture

Simpler to implement but lacks the clear separation of business rules from infrastructure concerns. Rejected due to technical constraints requiring Clean Architecture.

### Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters)

Similar to Clean Architecture with a focus on ports (interfaces) and adapters (implementations). Would be a viable alternative but Clean Architecture was explicitly required.

### CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)

Separates read and write operations but adds complexity. Could be incorporated within Clean Architecture for specific components if needed.

### Event-Driven Architecture

Focuses on event production, detection, and consumption. Will be used in conjunction with Clean Architecture for specific integration points.
