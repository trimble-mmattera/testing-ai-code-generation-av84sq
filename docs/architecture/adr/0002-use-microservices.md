# ADR 0002: Use Microservices

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The Document Management Platform requires a scalable, maintainable, and resilient architecture that can handle varying loads across different functional areas. The system needs to process 10,000 document uploads daily, provide fast search capabilities, and maintain strict tenant isolation. The technical specifications explicitly require implementation as microservices in Golang with containerization for Kubernetes deployment. Additionally, different components of the system have different scaling needs - for example, document processing may require more resources during high upload periods, while search capabilities need to scale based on query volume.

## Decision

We will implement the Document Management Platform using a microservices architecture. Each microservice will be developed in Golang, containerized for deployment in Kubernetes, and will internally follow the Clean Architecture principles defined in ADR-0001. Services will be decomposed based on business capabilities and domain boundaries, with clear interfaces between them.

## Service Decomposition

The system will be decomposed into the following microservices:

### API Gateway Service
Entry point for all client requests, handling authentication, request routing, and rate limiting. Responsible for JWT validation, tenant context extraction, and directing requests to appropriate backend services.

### Document Service
Manages document metadata, lifecycle, and coordinates document operations. Responsible for document creation, retrieval, update, and deletion operations, as well as maintaining document-folder relationships.

### Storage Service
Handles document storage operations with AWS S3, including encryption and temporary/permanent storage management. Responsible for uploading, downloading, and managing document content in S3 buckets.

### Search Service
Provides content and metadata search capabilities using Elasticsearch. Responsible for indexing document content and metadata, and executing search queries with proper tenant isolation.

### Folder Service
Manages folder hierarchy and organization within the system. Responsible for folder creation, retrieval, update, and deletion, as well as maintaining the folder structure.

### Virus Scanning Service
Scans uploaded documents for malicious content using ClamAV. Responsible for processing the scanning queue and determining document disposition based on scan results.

### Authentication Service
Validates JWTs and extracts tenant context for all operations. Responsible for token validation, tenant context extraction, and role-based permission verification.

### Event Service
Manages domain events and webhook notifications. Responsible for publishing events and delivering webhook notifications to external systems.

## Communication Patterns

Services will communicate using the following patterns:

### Synchronous Communication
REST APIs for direct service-to-service communication when immediate response is required. All APIs will use JSON for data exchange and follow consistent error handling patterns.

### Asynchronous Communication
AWS SQS for queuing tasks that can be processed asynchronously, such as document processing, virus scanning, and content indexing. This pattern will be used for operations that may take longer to complete.

### Event-Driven Communication
AWS SNS for publishing domain events that other services can subscribe to. This will be used for cross-service notifications and integration with external systems through webhooks.

## Deployment Strategy

Each microservice will be:

### Containerization
Packaged as Docker containers with appropriate base images and security hardening.

### Orchestration
Deployed to Kubernetes using Helm charts with appropriate resource requests and limits.

### Scaling
Configured with Horizontal Pod Autoscalers (HPA) based on CPU utilization, memory usage, and custom metrics like queue depth.

### Configuration
Configured using Kubernetes ConfigMaps and Secrets, with environment-specific settings.

### Health Monitoring
Implemented with liveness and readiness probes to ensure proper lifecycle management in Kubernetes.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Independent scalability of services based on their specific resource needs
- Improved fault isolation, preventing cascading failures across the system
- Technology flexibility within the constraints of Golang and Kubernetes
- Independent deployment of services, enabling faster release cycles
- Clear boundaries between different functional areas of the system
- Easier team organization around specific services or domains
- Better alignment with cloud-native infrastructure and practices

### Negative
- Increased operational complexity with multiple services to manage
- Distributed system challenges like network latency and partial failures
- Need for robust service discovery and communication patterns
- Potential data consistency challenges across service boundaries
- More complex testing and debugging across service boundaries
- Increased infrastructure costs due to redundancy and overhead
- Learning curve for developers new to microservices architecture

## Implementation

The implementation will follow these guidelines:

### Service Structure
Each microservice will follow the Clean Architecture principles defined in ADR-0001, with clear separation of domain, application, infrastructure, and API layers.

### API Design
RESTful APIs with consistent patterns for resources, error handling, and pagination. All APIs will be documented using OpenAPI/Swagger.

### Authentication and Authorization
JWT-based authentication with tenant context and role-based access control. The API Gateway will validate tokens and pass tenant context to downstream services.

### Data Management
Each service will manage its own data, with PostgreSQL for structured data and appropriate caching strategies. Cross-service data access will be through APIs rather than shared databases.

### Resilience Patterns
Circuit breakers, retries with exponential backoff, and fallback mechanisms for handling failures in service-to-service communication.

### Observability
Consistent logging, metrics, and distributed tracing across all services to enable monitoring and troubleshooting.

### CI/CD Pipeline
Automated build, test, and deployment pipelines for each microservice, with appropriate quality gates.

## Alternatives Considered

### Monolithic Architecture
A single application containing all functionality. Rejected due to scalability limitations, as different components have different resource needs, and the technical requirement for microservices.

### Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)
Larger, more coarse-grained services with shared data stores. Rejected in favor of more fine-grained microservices with better isolation and scalability characteristics.

### Serverless Architecture
Function-as-a-Service approach with AWS Lambda or similar. Rejected due to potential cold start issues, execution time limitations, and the explicit requirement for Kubernetes deployment.

### Modular Monolith
Single deployment unit with clear internal module boundaries. Rejected due to the scalability requirements and explicit technical constraint for microservices.
