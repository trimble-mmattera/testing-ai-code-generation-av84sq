# ADR 0004: PostgreSQL for Metadata

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The Document Management Platform requires a reliable, performant, and secure database solution for storing document metadata, user information, folder structures, permissions, and other relational data. While document content will be stored in AWS S3 as defined in ADR-0003, the system needs a complementary database solution for structured metadata that supports complex queries, transactions, and maintains data integrity. The database must support the multi-tenant architecture with strict tenant isolation, handle the expected scale of 10,000 document uploads daily, and provide the necessary performance for search and retrieval operations.

## Decision

We will use PostgreSQL (version 14.0+) as the primary database for storing all metadata in the Document Management Platform. PostgreSQL will be used in conjunction with AWS S3, which will store the actual document content as defined in ADR-0003. The application will interact with PostgreSQL through the GORM ORM library to provide a clean abstraction layer consistent with our Clean Architecture approach.

## Database Schema Design

The PostgreSQL database schema will be designed to support the core entities and relationships of the Document Management Platform:

### Core Entities

- **Tenants**: Customer organizations using the platform
- **Users**: System users with specific roles
- **Documents**: Metadata for uploaded files
- **DocumentVersions**: Specific versions of documents
- **Folders**: Organizational structure for documents
- **Permissions**: Access control for documents and folders
- **Tags**: Metadata labels for documents

Each entity will have appropriate relationships, constraints, and indexes to ensure data integrity and query performance.

### Indexing Strategy

The database will implement a comprehensive indexing strategy to optimize query performance:

- B-tree indexes on frequently queried columns (tenant_id, folder_id, etc.)
- Composite indexes for common query patterns
- Unique constraints on business keys
- Full-text search indexes for metadata search capabilities
- Foreign key indexes for join optimization

### Data Types

PostgreSQL's rich data type support will be leveraged for the schema:

- UUID for primary keys and references
- JSONB for flexible metadata storage
- Text and VARCHAR for string data
- Timestamp with time zone for temporal data
- Boolean for flags and status indicators
- Integer and Bigint for numeric data

### Constraints and Validation

Data integrity will be enforced through:

- Primary key constraints
- Foreign key constraints with appropriate cascade behaviors
- Not null constraints for required fields
- Unique constraints for business uniqueness rules
- Check constraints for value validation
- Default values for standard fields

## Tenant Isolation Strategy

To ensure complete isolation between tenants, we will implement a multi-layered approach:

### Tenant ID Column

Every table that contains tenant-specific data will include a `tenant_id` column with a foreign key reference to the tenants table. This provides a foundation for tenant isolation.

### Row-Level Security

PostgreSQL's Row-Level Security (RLS) policies will be implemented to enforce tenant isolation at the database level. This provides an additional security layer beyond application-level filtering.

### Application-Level Filtering

All queries will include tenant context filtering to ensure that data from one tenant is never exposed to another tenant. This will be enforced through repository implementations and database middleware.

### Partitioning

For large tables (documents, document_versions), we will implement tenant-based partitioning to improve query performance and maintain isolation. This will be particularly important as the system scales with more tenants and documents.

## Performance Optimization

To meet the performance requirements of the system, we will implement several optimization strategies:

### Connection Pooling

We will use connection pooling with PgBouncer to efficiently manage database connections. This will be configured with appropriate pool sizes, idle timeouts, and maximum lifetimes based on service requirements.

### Query Optimization

Queries will be optimized through:

- Prepared statements to reduce parsing overhead
- Appropriate use of indexes
- Query plan analysis and tuning
- Limiting result sets with pagination
- Optimized join strategies

### Caching Strategy

A multi-level caching strategy will be implemented:

- Redis for frequently accessed metadata
- Application-level caching for reference data
- Query result caching for expensive operations
- Connection pooling to reduce connection overhead

### Read/Write Splitting

For high-scale deployments, we will implement read/write splitting:

- Primary database for writes and critical reads
- Read replicas for standard read operations
- Load balancing across read replicas
- Consistency management between primary and replicas

## Consequences

### Positive

- ACID compliance ensures data integrity for critical metadata
- Rich query capabilities support complex search and filtering requirements
- JSON support provides flexibility for varying metadata schemas
- Strong indexing capabilities enable efficient queries
- Mature ecosystem with extensive tooling and monitoring options
- Robust security features including row-level security for tenant isolation
- Excellent support for transactions and complex operations
- Scalability through replication, partitioning, and connection pooling
- Open-source with strong community support and documentation

### Negative

- Requires more operational expertise than some NoSQL alternatives
- Vertical scaling limitations compared to some distributed databases
- Schema migrations require careful planning and execution
- Connection management needs attention at high scale
- Potential performance impact with very large datasets without proper optimization

## Implementation

The implementation will follow these guidelines:

### Database Access Layer

Following Clean Architecture principles, we will implement a database access layer with:

- Repository interfaces defined in the domain layer
- PostgreSQL implementations in the infrastructure layer
- GORM as the ORM library for database operations
- Custom query builders for complex queries
- Transaction management for multi-step operations

### Migration Strategy

Database schema evolution will be managed through:

- Versioned migration scripts
- Forward and rollback migrations
- Automated testing of migrations
- Controlled deployment process
- Schema version tracking

### Deployment Configuration

PostgreSQL will be deployed with:

- Multi-AZ configuration for high availability
- Automated backups and point-in-time recovery
- Monitoring and alerting for performance and availability
- Appropriate instance sizing based on workload
- Security groups and network isolation

### Error Handling

Database errors will be handled with:

- Specific error types for different database failures
- Retry mechanisms for transient errors
- Circuit breaking for persistent failures
- Detailed logging for troubleshooting
- Graceful degradation when possible

## Alternatives Considered

### MongoDB

A document-oriented NoSQL database. Provides flexibility for schema-less data but lacks the strong ACID guarantees and relational capabilities needed for complex metadata relationships and transactions.

### MySQL

Another relational database option. Comparable to PostgreSQL in many aspects but lacks some advanced features like JSONB support, table partitioning capabilities, and has less robust concurrency handling.

### DynamoDB

AWS's managed NoSQL database. Offers excellent scalability and integration with AWS services but has limitations for complex queries, joins, and transactions that are essential for our metadata model.

### Cassandra

Distributed NoSQL database designed for high scalability. Better suited for write-heavy workloads with simple query patterns, but our system requires complex queries and strong consistency guarantees.

### CockroachDB

Distributed SQL database with PostgreSQL compatibility. A viable alternative that offers global distribution, but adds complexity and cost without clear benefits for our current scale requirements.
