# Virus Scanning Implementation

## Virus Scanning Overview

The Document Management Platform implements a comprehensive virus scanning solution to protect against malicious content in uploaded documents. This document outlines the virus scanning architecture, process flow, quarantine management, and security considerations implemented throughout the platform.

## Scanning Architecture

The virus scanning architecture is designed to provide secure, scalable, and reliable detection of malicious content in uploaded documents.

### ClamAV Integration

The platform integrates with ClamAV, an open-source antivirus engine, for virus detection:

- **Implementation**: Containerized ClamAV service with regular signature updates
- **Signature Updates**: Automatic daily updates with manual update capability
- **Scan Engine**: In-memory scanning for optimal performance
- **Isolation**: Scanning occurs in an isolated environment to prevent infection spread

Example ClamAV client configuration:

```yaml
virus_scanning:
  clamav:
    address: "clamav-service:3310"
    timeout: 30s
    max_file_size: 100MB
    scan_depth: 3
```

### Queue-Based Processing

Document scanning is implemented using a queue-based architecture to ensure reliability and scalability:

- **Queue Implementation**: AWS SQS for reliable message delivery
- **Dead Letter Queue**: Captures failed scan attempts for investigation
- **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff with maximum 3 retry attempts
- **Batch Processing**: Configurable batch size for optimal throughput

Example queue configuration:

```yaml
scan_queue:
  name: "document-scan-queue"
  dead_letter_queue: "document-scan-dlq"
  visibility_timeout: 300
  max_receive_count: 3
  batch_size: 10
```

### Component Interaction

The virus scanning solution consists of several interacting components:

- **Document Service**: Coordinates the document upload workflow
- **Storage Service**: Manages document storage in temporary, permanent, and quarantine locations
- **Virus Scanning Service**: Processes the scan queue and performs virus detection
- **ClamAV Client**: Communicates with the ClamAV daemon for actual scanning
- **Event Service**: Publishes events related to document scanning status

These components work together to ensure all uploaded documents are scanned before being made available to users.

### Metrics and Monitoring

Comprehensive metrics are collected to monitor the virus scanning process:

- **Scan Throughput**: Documents scanned per minute
- **Detection Rate**: Percentage of documents identified as malicious
- **Processing Time**: Time taken to scan documents of various sizes
- **Queue Depth**: Number of documents waiting to be scanned
- **Error Rate**: Failed scan attempts and reasons

These metrics are exposed through Prometheus and visualized in Grafana dashboards for operational monitoring.

## Scanning Process Flow

The document scanning process follows a well-defined flow from upload to final disposition.

### Upload and Queueing

When a document is uploaded to the platform:

1. The document is stored in a temporary S3 location with encryption
2. Document metadata is recorded in the database with a 'processing' status
3. A scan task is created with document ID, version ID, tenant ID, and storage path
4. The scan task is queued in AWS SQS for asynchronous processing
5. The API returns a 202 Accepted response with a tracking ID

This approach allows the upload API to respond quickly while scanning happens asynchronously.

### Scan Processing

The Virus Scanning Service processes queued documents:

1. The service polls the SQS queue for scan tasks
2. For each task, the document is retrieved from temporary storage
3. The document content is streamed to ClamAV for scanning
4. ClamAV returns a scan result (clean, infected, or error)
5. The scan result is processed based on the outcome

Example scan processing code:

```go
// ScanDocument scans a document for viruses
func (s *VirusScanner) ScanDocument(ctx context.Context, storagePath string) (string, string, error) {
    // Get document content from storage
    content, err := s.storageService.GetDocument(ctx, storagePath)
    if err != nil {
        return services.ScanResultError, "", errors.Wrap(err, "failed to get document content")
    }
    defer content.Close()
    
    // Scan the document content
    isClean, details, err := s.scannerClient.ScanStream(ctx, content)
    if err != nil {
        return services.ScanResultError, err.Error(), errors.Wrap(err, "scan failed")
    }
    
    if isClean {
        return services.ScanResultClean, "", nil
    }
    
    return services.ScanResultInfected, details, nil
}
```

### Clean Document Handling

When a document is determined to be clean:

1. The document is moved from temporary to permanent storage
2. Document metadata is updated with 'available' status
3. Document content is indexed for search capabilities
4. A `document.processed` event is published with clean status
5. The scan task is marked as complete in the queue

Clean documents become available for user access and search operations.

### Infected Document Handling

When a document is determined to be infected:

1. The document is moved from temporary to quarantine storage
2. Document metadata is updated with 'quarantined' status and virus details
3. A `document.quarantined` event is published with virus information
4. The scan task is marked as complete in the queue
5. Security alerts are triggered based on configuration

Infected documents are never made available to users and remain in quarantine for security analysis.

### Error Handling

When a scan operation encounters an error:

1. The error is logged with detailed context
2. If retry count is below maximum, the task is requeued with incremented retry count
3. After maximum retries, the task is moved to the dead letter queue
4. Document metadata is updated with 'scan_failed' status
5. A `document.scan_failed` event is published with error details

Failed scans are monitored and can be manually resolved by administrators.

### Sequence Diagram

The following sequence diagram illustrates the complete virus scanning process flow:

```
Client -> API Gateway: Upload Document
API Gateway -> Document Service: Process Upload
Document Service -> Storage Service: Store in Temporary Location
Storage Service -> S3: Upload to Temp Bucket
Document Service -> SQS: Queue for Scanning
API Gateway -> Client: 202 Accepted with Tracking ID

SQS -> Virus Scanning Service: Dequeue Scan Task
Virus Scanning Service -> Storage Service: Get Document Content
Storage Service -> S3: Download from Temp Bucket
Virus Scanning Service -> ClamAV: Scan Document Content
ClamAV -> Virus Scanning Service: Scan Result

alt Clean Document
    Virus Scanning Service -> Storage Service: Move to Permanent Storage
    Storage Service -> S3: Copy to Permanent Bucket
    Storage Service -> S3: Delete from Temp Bucket
    Virus Scanning Service -> Document Service: Update Status (Available)
    Document Service -> Search Service: Index Document
    Virus Scanning Service -> Event Service: Publish document.processed Event
else Infected Document
    Virus Scanning Service -> Storage Service: Move to Quarantine
    Storage Service -> S3: Copy to Quarantine Bucket
    Storage Service -> S3: Delete from Temp Bucket
    Virus Scanning Service -> Document Service: Update Status (Quarantined)
    Virus Scanning Service -> Event Service: Publish document.quarantined Event
end
```

## Quarantine Management

The platform implements a secure quarantine system for managing infected documents.

### Quarantine Storage

Infected documents are stored in a dedicated quarantine location:

- **Storage Implementation**: Dedicated S3 bucket for quarantined files
- **Path Structure**: `quarantine/{tenantID}/{documentID}`
- **Access Controls**: Highly restricted access limited to security personnel
- **Encryption**: Server-side encryption using AWS KMS with dedicated key

Example quarantine implementation:

```go
// MoveToQuarantine moves an infected document to quarantine storage
func (s *s3Storage) MoveToQuarantine(ctx context.Context, tenantID, documentID, versionID, sourcePath string) (string, error) {
    // Generate quarantine path with tenant isolation
    quarantinePath := fmt.Sprintf("quarantine/%s/%s/%s", tenantID, documentID, versionID)
    
    // Copy from temporary to quarantine location
    copyInput := &s3.CopyObjectInput{
        Bucket:               aws.String(s.config.QuarantineBucket),
        Key:                  aws.String(quarantinePath),
        CopySource:           aws.String(fmt.Sprintf("%s/%s", s.config.TempBucket, sourcePath)),
        ServerSideEncryption: aws.String("aws:kms"),
        SSEKMSKeyId:          aws.String(s.config.QuarantineKMSKeyID),
    }
    
    _, err := s.client.CopyObject(copyInput)
    if err != nil {
        return "", err
    }
    
    // Delete from temporary location
    _, err = s.client.DeleteObject(&s3.DeleteObjectInput{
        Bucket: aws.String(s.config.TempBucket),
        Key:    aws.String(sourcePath),
    })
    
    return quarantinePath, err
}
```

### Metadata Tracking

Detailed metadata is maintained for quarantined documents:

- **Document Status**: Marked as 'quarantined' in the database
- **Virus Information**: Name and type of detected malware
- **Quarantine Time**: Timestamp of quarantine action
- **Quarantine Location**: Path to quarantined document
- **Upload Context**: Original uploader information for investigation

This metadata supports security analysis and incident response.

### Notification System

The platform implements notifications for quarantine events:

- **Security Alerts**: Immediate alerts to security personnel for critical threats
- **User Notifications**: Notification to document owner about quarantine action
- **Admin Dashboard**: Quarantine events displayed in admin security dashboard
- **Event Publication**: `document.quarantined` events for integration with external systems

Notifications ensure timely awareness and response to security incidents.

### Retention Policy

Quarantined documents are subject to a specific retention policy:

- **Retention Period**: 90 days by default (configurable per tenant)
- **Lifecycle Rules**: Automated S3 lifecycle rules for expiration
- **Legal Hold**: Option to place legal hold on specific documents
- **Manual Override**: Security personnel can extend retention for investigation

The retention policy balances security analysis needs with storage optimization.

### Security Analysis

Quarantined documents can be analyzed by security personnel:

- **Secure Viewer**: Specialized tool for safely viewing quarantined content
- **Metadata Analysis**: Review of document metadata and context
- **Advanced Scanning**: Additional scanning with specialized tools
- **Threat Intelligence**: Integration with threat intelligence platforms

Analysis capabilities help identify patterns and prevent future threats.

## Security Considerations

The virus scanning implementation addresses several important security considerations.

### Scanning Limitations

Understanding the limitations of virus scanning is important:

- **Zero-Day Threats**: New malware may not be detected by signature-based scanning
- **File Size Limits**: Very large files (>100MB) may timeout during scanning
- **Encrypted Content**: Encrypted portions of documents cannot be effectively scanned
- **Complex Formats**: Some document formats may have limited scanning coverage

These limitations are mitigated through defense-in-depth strategies and regular updates.

### Defense in Depth

The platform implements multiple layers of protection:

- **Signature-Based Scanning**: Primary detection using ClamAV signatures
- **Behavioral Analysis**: Monitoring for suspicious document behavior
- **Tenant Isolation**: Complete isolation prevents cross-tenant infection
- **Least Privilege**: Restricted permissions for document processing
- **Secure Processing**: Isolated environment for document handling

This multi-layered approach provides comprehensive protection against various threats.

### Signature Updates

Keeping virus definitions current is critical:

- **Automatic Updates**: Daily signature updates from ClamAV repositories
- **Update Verification**: Signature integrity verification before application
- **Manual Updates**: Capability for immediate updates in response to threats
- **Update Monitoring**: Alerts for failed or missed updates

Regular updates ensure the system can detect the latest known threats.

### Performance vs. Security

The implementation balances performance and security:

- **Streaming Scan**: Documents are scanned as streams to minimize memory usage
- **Scan Depth**: Configurable recursion depth for archive scanning
- **Timeout Handling**: Graceful handling of scan timeouts for large documents
- **Resource Allocation**: Dedicated resources for scanning operations

This balance ensures thorough scanning without excessive performance impact.

### Incident Response

Procedures are in place for responding to virus detections:

- **Immediate Quarantine**: Automatic isolation of infected documents
- **Security Notification**: Alerts to security team for analysis
- **Threat Assessment**: Evaluation of potential impact and spread
