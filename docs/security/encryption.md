# Encryption Implementation

## Encryption Overview

The Document Management Platform implements a comprehensive encryption strategy to protect sensitive data both at rest and in transit. This document outlines the encryption mechanisms, key management practices, and compliance considerations implemented throughout the platform.

## Data Encryption at Rest

All data stored within the Document Management Platform is encrypted at rest to protect against unauthorized access to storage systems.

### Document Storage Encryption

Documents stored in AWS S3 are encrypted using Server-Side Encryption with AWS Key Management Service (SSE-KMS):

- **Encryption Algorithm**: AES-256
- **Key Management**: AWS KMS with customer-managed keys (CMK)
- **Implementation**: Automatic encryption on upload through S3 API
- **Bucket Policy**: Enforces encryption for all objects

Example S3 upload with encryption:

```go
uploadInput := &s3manager.UploadInput{
    Bucket:               aws.String(bucket),
    Key:                  aws.String(key),
    Body:                 content,
    ContentType:          aws.String(contentType),
    ServerSideEncryption: aws.String("aws:kms"),
    SSEKMSKeyId:          aws.String(s.config.KMSKeyID),
}
```

### Database Encryption

Metadata stored in PostgreSQL is protected using:

- **RDS Encryption**: AWS RDS with encryption enabled
- **Encryption Algorithm**: AES-256
- **Key Management**: AWS KMS with customer-managed keys (CMK)
- **Column-Level Encryption**: Sensitive fields are additionally encrypted at the application level

Example database configuration in Terraform:

```hcl
resource "aws_db_instance" "postgres" {
  # ... other configuration ...
  storage_encrypted = true
  kms_key_id        = aws_kms_key.database.arn
}
```

### Cache Encryption

Data stored in Redis cache is encrypted using:

- **Redis Encryption**: AWS ElastiCache with encryption enabled
- **Encryption Algorithm**: AES-256
- **Key Management**: AWS KMS with customer-managed keys (CMK)
- **Data Classification**: Only non-sensitive data is cached, with appropriate TTLs

### Backup Encryption

All backups are encrypted to ensure data protection throughout the data lifecycle:

- **S3 Backups**: Encrypted using the same SSE-KMS mechanism as primary storage
- **Database Backups**: Encrypted using AWS RDS backup encryption
- **Snapshot Encryption**: All EBS snapshots are encrypted
- **Cross-Region Replication**: Encryption is maintained during replication

## Data Encryption in Transit

All data transmitted to, from, and within the Document Management Platform is encrypted to protect against interception and man-in-the-middle attacks.

### External Communications

Communications between clients and the platform are secured using:

- **Protocol**: HTTPS with TLS 1.2+ required
- **Cipher Suites**: Modern, secure cipher suites with forward secrecy
- **Certificate Management**: AWS Certificate Manager with automatic renewal
- **HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)**: Enforced for all communications

Example API Gateway configuration:

```yaml
api_gateway:
  security:
    minimum_tls_version: "TLSv1.2"
    preferred_cipher_suites:
      - "TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384"
      - "TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256"
    hsts_enabled: true
    hsts_max_age: 31536000  # 1 year
```

### Internal Service Communication

Communications between microservices within the platform are secured using:

- **Service Mesh TLS**: Mutual TLS (mTLS) for service-to-service communication
- **Certificate Rotation**: Automatic certificate rotation
- **Certificate Authority**: Internal PKI for certificate issuance and validation
- **Network Policies**: Kubernetes network policies restricting communication paths

### Database Connections

Connections to databases are secured using:

- **TLS Encryption**: Required for all database connections
- **Certificate Validation**: Server certificate validation
- **Connection Pooling**: Secure connection management

Example database connection configuration:

```yaml
database:
  connection:
    ssl_mode: "verify-full"
    ssl_root_cert: "/path/to/ca.pem"
    ssl_cert: "/path/to/client-cert.pem"
    ssl_key: "/path/to/client-key.pem"
```

### AWS Service Connections

Connections to AWS services are secured using:

- **HTTPS Endpoints**: All AWS API calls use HTTPS
- **VPC Endpoints**: Private connections to AWS services where possible
- **Signature Version 4**: AWS API request signing for authentication and integrity
- **IAM Roles**: Least privilege access for service connections

## Key Management

The Document Management Platform implements a robust key management strategy to secure encryption keys and ensure their proper lifecycle management.

### AWS KMS Integration

AWS Key Management Service (KMS) is used for centralized key management:

- **Customer Master Keys (CMKs)**: Dedicated CMKs for different data categories
- **Key Hierarchy**: Data encryption keys (DEKs) protected by CMKs
- **Key Rotation**: Automatic annual rotation of CMKs
- **Key Access Control**: IAM policies restricting key usage

Example KMS key configuration in Terraform:

```hcl
resource "aws_kms_key" "document_encryption" {
  description             = "KMS key for document encryption"
  deletion_window_in_days = 30
  enable_key_rotation     = true
  policy                  = data.aws_iam_policy_document.kms_policy.json
  tags = {
    Name        = "${var.project_name}-${var.environment}-document-kms-key"
    Environment = var.environment
  }
}
```

### Key Separation

Different keys are used for different purposes to limit the impact of key compromise:

- **Document Encryption Key**: For document content in S3
- **Database Encryption Key**: For metadata in PostgreSQL
- **Backup Encryption Key**: For backup data
- **JWT Signing Keys**: For authentication tokens

This separation ensures that compromise of one key does not affect all data categories.

### Key Access Controls

Access to encryption keys is strictly controlled:

- **IAM Roles**: Least privilege principle for key access
- **Key Administrators**: Separate roles for key administration
- **Key Users**: Limited to specific services and operations
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all key operations

Example KMS key policy:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "Enable IAM User Permissions",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::${account_id}:root"
      },
      "Action": "kms:*",
      "Resource": "*"
    },
    {
      "Sid": "Allow use of the key for document service",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::${account_id}:role/document-service-role"
      },
      "Action": [
        "kms:Encrypt",
        "kms:Decrypt",
        "kms:GenerateDataKey"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Key Rotation

Regular key rotation is implemented to limit the impact of potential key compromise:

- **CMK Rotation**: Automatic annual rotation
- **JWT Signing Keys**: Manual rotation with overlap period
- **TLS Certificates**: Automatic rotation before expiration
- **Rotation Monitoring**: Alerts for failed or missed rotations

## JWT Token Security

JWT tokens used for authentication are secured using cryptographic signatures:

### Signature Algorithm

- **Algorithm**: RS256 (RSA Signature with SHA-256)
- **Key Strength**: 2048-bit RSA keys
- **Key Storage**: Private key securely stored, accessible only to authentication service
- **Key Rotation**: Regular rotation with overlap period for smooth transition

### Token Protection

- **No Sensitive Data**: Tokens contain only identifiers, not sensitive information
- **Short Lifetime**: Access tokens valid for 1 hour by default
- **Transport Security**: Tokens transmitted only over HTTPS
- **Validation**: Comprehensive validation of all token claims

## Encryption Implementation

The encryption mechanisms are implemented across several components of the platform:

### S3 Storage Service

The `s3_storage.go` implementation ensures all documents are encrypted:

```go
// StoreTemporary stores a document in temporary storage with encryption
func (s *s3Storage) StoreTemporary(ctx context.Context, tenantID, documentID string, content io.Reader, size int64, contentType string) (string, error) {
    // ... validation and path generation ...
    
    uploadInput := &s3manager.UploadInput{
        Bucket:               aws.String(s.config.TempBucket),
        Key:                  aws.String(key),
        Body:                 content,
        ContentType:          aws.String(contentType),
        ServerSideEncryption: aws.String("aws:kms"),
        SSEKMSKeyId:          aws.String(s.config.KMSKeyID),
    }
    
    // ... upload and error handling ...
}
```

### Database Repositories

Database repositories implement additional encryption for sensitive fields:

```go
// StoreDocument stores document metadata with encryption for sensitive fields
func (r *documentRepository) StoreDocument(ctx context.Context, doc *models.Document) error {
    // ... prepare document data ...
    
    // Encrypt sensitive metadata if present
    if doc.HasSensitiveMetadata() {
        encryptedMetadata, err := r.encryptionService.Encrypt(ctx, doc.SensitiveMetadata)
        if err != nil {
            return errors.Wrap(err, "failed to encrypt sensitive metadata")
        }
        doc.SensitiveMetadata = encryptedMetadata
    }
    
    // ... database operations ...
}
```

### JWT Authentication

The JWT service implements secure token signing:

```go
// GenerateToken generates a signed JWT token
func (s *jwtService) GenerateToken(ctx context.Context, userID, tenantID string, roles []string, expiration time.Duration) (string, error) {
    // ... prepare claims ...
    
    token := jwt.NewWithClaims(jwt.SigningMethodRS256, claims)
    signedToken, err := token.SignedString(s.privateKey)
    if err != nil {
        return "", errors.Wrap(err, "failed to sign token")
    }
    
    return signedToken, nil
}
```

### TLS Configuration

The API server is configured with secure TLS settings:

```go
// configureTLS sets up secure TLS configuration
func configureTLS(server *http.Server, cfg config.TLSConfig) error {
    tlsConfig := &tls.Config{
        MinVersion: tls.VersionTLS12,
        CipherSuites: []uint16{
            tls.TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384,
            tls.TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256,
            // ... other secure cipher suites ...
        },
        PreferServerCipherSuites: true,
    }
    
    // ... certificate loading ...
    
    server.TLSConfig = tlsConfig
    return nil
}
```
