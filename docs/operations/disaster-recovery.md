# Disaster Recovery Plan

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the disaster recovery plan for the Document Management Platform. It provides comprehensive procedures for recovering from various failure scenarios, ensuring business continuity, and maintaining data integrity. The plan addresses infrastructure failures, data corruption, security incidents, and service disruptions.

### 1.1 Purpose and Scope

The purpose of this disaster recovery plan is to establish procedures for recovering the Document Management Platform in the event of a disaster or major service disruption. The plan covers all components of the platform, including document storage, metadata database, search functionality, and application services.

### 1.2 Recovery Objectives

The Document Management Platform has the following recovery objectives:

- Recovery Time Objective (RTO): 4 hours
- Recovery Point Objective (RPO): 15 minutes
- System Availability Target: 99.99% uptime

These objectives guide the design and implementation of disaster recovery procedures.

### 1.3 Disaster Recovery Strategy

The platform implements a warm standby disaster recovery strategy with the following key components:

- Multi-AZ deployment for high availability within a region
- Cross-region replication for document storage (S3)
- Database replication with automated failover
- Regular backups with cross-region replication
- Infrastructure as Code for rapid environment reconstruction

This strategy balances recovery speed, cost, and complexity to meet the defined recovery objectives.

## 2. Backup Procedures

Comprehensive backup procedures ensure that all critical data and configuration can be recovered in the event of a disaster.

### 2.1 Document Storage Backups

Document content stored in AWS S3 is protected through:

- Cross-region replication for all S3 buckets
- Versioning enabled on all buckets to protect against accidental deletion or corruption
- Lifecycle policies to manage object versions and transitions
- Regular integrity checks on replicated data

Backup configuration in Terraform:
```hcl
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "document_bucket" {
  bucket = "${var.project_name}-${var.environment}-documents"
  # ...
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket_versioning" "document_bucket_versioning" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.document_bucket.id
  versioning_configuration {
    status = "Enabled"
  }
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket_replication_configuration" "document_bucket_replication" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.document_bucket.id
  role   = aws_iam_role.replication_role.arn

  rule {
    id     = "document-replication"
    status = "Enabled"

    destination {
      bucket        = aws_s3_bucket.dr_document_bucket.arn
      storage_class = "STANDARD"
    }
  }
}
```

### 2.2 Database Backups

Metadata stored in PostgreSQL is backed up through:

- Daily automated snapshots with 30-day retention
- Continuous WAL (Write-Ahead Log) archiving to S3 with 7-day retention
- Cross-region replication of backup data
- Point-in-time recovery capability

Database backup configuration in Terraform:
```hcl
resource "aws_db_instance" "metadata_db" {
  # ...
  backup_retention_period = 30
  backup_window           = "03:00-05:00"
  copy_tags_to_snapshot   = true
  deletion_protection     = true
  # ...
}

resource "aws_db_instance" "metadata_db_replica" {
  # ...
  replicate_source_db    = aws_db_instance.metadata_db.identifier
  backup_retention_period = 7
  # ...
}
```

### 2.3 Configuration Backups

System configuration is backed up through:

- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform) in version control
- Kubernetes manifests in version control
- Application configuration in ConfigMaps and Secrets, backed up regularly
- CI/CD pipeline configuration in version control

All configuration is stored in Git repositories with appropriate backup and redundancy measures.

### 2.4 Backup Verification

Regular backup verification ensures that backups are valid and can be used for recovery:

- Weekly automated restore tests for database backups
- Monthly verification of S3 cross-region replication
- Quarterly full recovery tests in an isolated environment
- Automated integrity checks on all backups

Verification results are documented and any issues are addressed immediately.

## 3. Disaster Scenarios

This section outlines potential disaster scenarios that could impact the Document Management Platform and their potential business impact.

### 3.1 Infrastructure Failures

Infrastructure failures include:

- Availability Zone (AZ) failure: Loss of a single AZ in AWS
- Region failure: Complete loss of an AWS region
