# Monitoring and Observability

## Introduction

This document provides comprehensive information about the monitoring and observability approach for the Document Management Platform. It covers metrics collection, log aggregation, distributed tracing, alerting, and incident response procedures. The monitoring infrastructure is designed to ensure 99.99% system uptime and meet the performance SLAs defined in the technical specifications.

## Monitoring Architecture

The Document Management Platform implements a comprehensive monitoring architecture that provides visibility into system health, performance, and business operations. The architecture follows a multi-layered approach with specialized tools for different observability aspects.

### Architecture Overview

The monitoring architecture consists of the following components:

- **Metrics Collection**: Prometheus for collecting and storing time-series metrics
- **Log Aggregation**: Fluent Bit for collecting logs and forwarding to Elasticsearch
- **Distributed Tracing**: Jaeger for tracking request flows across microservices
- **Visualization**: Grafana for dashboards and visualization
- **Alerting**: AlertManager for routing alerts to appropriate channels

All components are deployed in Kubernetes alongside the application services, with appropriate resource allocations and high availability configurations.

### Component Deployment

All monitoring components are deployed in the Kubernetes cluster using Helm charts with the following configuration approach:

- **High Availability**: Critical components (Prometheus, Elasticsearch, AlertManager) are deployed with multiple replicas
- **Resource Allocation**: Each component has appropriate CPU and memory requests/limits
- **Persistent Storage**: Time-series data and logs use persistent volumes with appropriate retention policies
- **Security**: All components use TLS for communication and authentication for access control

The monitoring stack is deployed in a dedicated namespace (`monitoring`) to isolate it from application workloads.

### Deployment Environments

The monitoring infrastructure is deployed across the following environments, each with specific configurations:

- **Development Environment**: Single-instance deployment with minimal resource allocation, primarily for testing monitoring configurations. Retention periods are shorter (7 days for metrics, 14 days for logs).

- **Staging Environment**: Multi-instance deployment with moderate resource allocation, mimicking production setup but at a smaller scale. Used for testing monitoring configurations before production deployment.

- **Production Environment**: Fully redundant deployment with high availability configurations. Multiple Prometheus instances, Elasticsearch cluster with 3+ nodes, and redundant alerting paths. Longer retention periods (30+ days for metrics, 90+ days for logs).

Each environment has environment-specific alerting thresholds and notification configurations to prevent alert fatigue from non-production environments.

## Metrics Collection

The Document Management Platform uses Prometheus as the primary metrics collection system. Prometheus implements a pull-based model where metrics endpoints exposed by services are scraped at regular intervals.

### Prometheus Configuration

Prometheus is configured with the following settings:

- **Scrape Interval**: 15 seconds for all targets
- **Evaluation Interval**: 15 seconds for alerting rules
- **Retention Period**: 15 days for time-series data
- **Storage**: Persistent volume with appropriate sizing

The configuration includes scrape jobs for all platform services, Kubernetes components, and AWS resources through exporters.

```yaml
global:
  scrape_interval: 15s
  evaluation_interval: 15s
  scrape_timeout: 10s

alerting:
  alertmanagers:
  - static_configs:
    - targets: ["alertmanager:9093"]
    scheme: http
    timeout: 5s
    api_version: v2

rule_files:
  - "alert-rules.yml"

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: "prometheus"
    static_configs:
    - targets: ["localhost:9090"]
  
  - job_name: "document-service"
    kubernetes_sd_configs:
    - role: service
      namespaces:
        names: ["document-mgmt-prod", "document-mgmt-staging", "document-mgmt-dev"]
    relabel_configs:
    - source_labels: ["__meta_kubernetes_service_label_app"]
      action: keep
      regex: document-service
    - source_labels: ["__meta_kubernetes_namespace"]
      target_label: namespace
    - source_labels: ["__meta_kubernetes_service_name"]
      target_label: service
```

### Metrics Instrumentation

All services in the Document Management Platform are instrumented to expose metrics endpoints with the following categories of metrics:

- **Service Metrics**: Request counts, error rates, latencies
- **Business Metrics**: Document uploads, downloads, searches
- **Resource Metrics**: CPU, memory, disk usage
- **Custom Metrics**: Domain-specific metrics like virus detection counts

Services expose metrics on the `/metrics` endpoint in Prometheus format, which is scraped by the Prometheus server.

```go
// Example of metrics instrumentation in Go service
func initMetrics() {
    // HTTP request metrics
    requestCounter = prometheus.NewCounterVec(
        prometheus.CounterOpts{
            Name: "http_requests_total",
            Help: "Total number of HTTP requests",
        },
        []string{"method", "endpoint", "status"},
    )
    
    // Request duration metrics
    requestDuration = prometheus.NewHistogramVec(
        prometheus.HistogramOpts{
            Name:    "http_request_duration_seconds",
            Help:    "HTTP request duration in seconds",
            Buckets: prometheus.DefBuckets,
        },
        []string{"method", "endpoint"},
    )
    
    // Document processing metrics
    documentProcessingDuration = prometheus.NewHistogramVec(
        prometheus.HistogramOpts{
            Name:    "document_processing_duration_seconds",
            Help:    "Document processing duration in seconds",
            Buckets: []float64{1, 5, 10, 30, 60, 120, 300, 600},
        },
        []string{"status"},
    )
    
    // Register metrics with Prometheus
    prometheus.MustRegister(requestCounter)
    prometheus.MustRegister(requestDuration)
    prometheus.MustRegister(documentProcessingDuration)
}
```

### AWS Integration

The monitoring system integrates with AWS services using the following approaches:

- **CloudWatch Exporter**: Collects metrics from AWS services (S3, SQS, RDS)
- **AWS SDK Metrics**: Application services expose AWS SDK metrics
- **Custom Exporters**: Specialized exporters for specific AWS services

This integration provides visibility into AWS resource utilization, costs, and performance metrics relevant to the Document Management Platform.

## Log Aggregation

The Document Management Platform implements a centralized logging architecture to collect, process, and analyze logs from all components. This architecture ensures that logs are consistently formatted, properly indexed, and easily searchable.

### Log Collection

Logs are collected using Fluent Bit deployed as a DaemonSet in the Kubernetes cluster. Fluent Bit collects logs from the following sources:

- **Container Logs**: All container stdout/stderr logs
- **System Logs**: Host-level system logs
- **Application Logs**: Structured logs from application services

Fluent Bit is configured to parse, filter, and enrich logs before forwarding them to Elasticsearch.

```ini

```

### Log Storage and Indexing

Logs are stored in Elasticsearch with the following configuration:

- **Index Pattern**: Time-based indices with daily rotation
- **Retention Policy**: 30 days for standard logs, 1 year for audit logs
- **Mapping Templates**: Custom mappings for structured log fields
- **Index Lifecycle Management**: Automated index management policies

Elasticsearch provides full-text search capabilities and efficient storage for log data, enabling quick troubleshooting and analysis.

```json
{
  "index_patterns": ["document-mgmt-logs-*"],
  "template": {
    "settings": {
      "number_of_shards": 3,
      "number_of_replicas": 1,
      "index.lifecycle.name": "document-mgmt-logs-policy",
      "index.lifecycle.rollover_alias": "document-mgmt-logs"
    },
    "mappings": {
      "properties": {
        "@timestamp": { "type": "date" },
        "kubernetes": {
          "properties": {
            "namespace_name": { "type": "keyword" },
            "pod_name": { "type": "keyword" },
            "container_name": { "type": "keyword" },
            "labels": { "type": "object" }
          }
        },
        "level": { "type": "keyword" },
        "message": { "type": "text" },
        "tenant_id": { "type": "keyword" },
        "user_id": { "type": "keyword" },
        "document_id": { "type": "keyword" },
        "request_id": { "type": "keyword" },
        "trace_id": { "type": "keyword" },
        "span_id": { "type": "keyword" }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Log Visualization

Logs are visualized using Kibana with the following features:

- **Dashboards**: Pre-configured dashboards for different service types
- **Discover**: Interactive log exploration and filtering
- **Alerts**: Log-based alerting for critical patterns
- **Saved Searches**: Common queries for quick access

Kibana provides a user-friendly interface for log analysis, with role-based access control to ensure appropriate access to log data.

### Structured Logging

All services in the Document Management Platform use structured logging with a consistent JSON format. The log format includes the following standard fields:

- **timestamp**: ISO 8601 timestamp
- **level**: Log level (debug, info, warn, error, fatal)
- **message**: Human-readable log message
- **service**: Service name
- **tenant_id**: Tenant identifier for multi-tenancy
- **request_id**: Unique request identifier
- **trace_id**: Distributed tracing identifier
- **span_id**: Span identifier for tracing
- **user_id**: User identifier (when available)
- **additional_context**: Service-specific context data

This structured format enables consistent parsing, filtering, and correlation of logs across the platform.

```go
// Example of structured logging in Go service
func initLogger() *zap.Logger {
    logConfig := zap.NewProductionConfig()
    logConfig.EncoderConfig.TimeKey = "timestamp"
    logConfig.EncoderConfig.EncodeTime = zapcore.ISO8601TimeEncoder
    
    logger, err := logConfig.Build()
    if err != nil {
        panic("Failed to initialize logger: " + err.Error())
    }
    
    return logger
}

func logRequest(logger *zap.Logger, r *http.Request, tenantID, userID string) *zap.Logger {
    requestID := r.Header.Get("X-Request-ID")
    if requestID == "" {
        requestID = uuid.New().String()
    }
    
    traceID := r.Header.Get("X-Trace-ID")
    spanID := r.Header.Get("X-Span-ID")
    
    return logger.With(
        zap.String("request_id", requestID),
        zap.String("trace_id", traceID),
        zap.String("span_id", spanID),
        zap.String("tenant_id", tenantID),
        zap.String("user_id", userID),
        zap.String("method", r.Method),
        zap.String("path", r.URL.Path),
    )
}
```

## Distributed Tracing

The Document Management Platform implements distributed tracing to understand request flows across microservices. This capability is essential for troubleshooting performance issues and understanding service dependencies.

### Tracing Architecture

The distributed tracing architecture consists of the following components:

- **Jaeger**: Main tracing backend for collection, storage, and visualization
- **OpenTelemetry**: Instrumentation library for generating traces
- **W3C Trace Context**: Standard for propagating trace context between services

Traces are collected with a 10% sampling rate to balance observability and performance impact.

```mermaid

    style OtelCol fill:#bbf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style Jaeger fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

### Jaeger Configuration

Jaeger is configured with the following settings:

- **Collector**: Multiple replicas for high availability
- **Storage**: Elasticsearch for trace storage
- **Retention**: 72 hours for trace data
- **Sampling**: Probabilistic sampling at 10% rate
- **UI**: Custom UI configuration with Document Management Platform branding

The configuration ensures efficient trace collection and storage while providing a user-friendly interface for trace analysis.

```yaml

    index-prefix: "jaeger"
    max-span-age: "72h"
```

### Service Instrumentation

All services in the Document Management Platform are instrumented for distributed tracing using OpenTelemetry. The instrumentation includes:

- **HTTP Middleware**: Automatically traces incoming and outgoing HTTP requests
- **Database Calls**: Traces database operations with query information
- **AWS SDK Calls**: Traces AWS service calls
- **Custom Spans**: Manual instrumentation for business logic

Trace context is propagated between services using W3C Trace Context headers, ensuring consistent tracing across the entire request flow.

```go
// Example of tracing instrumentation in Go service
func initTracer() *trace.Tracer {
    exporter, err := jaeger.NewRawExporter(
        jaeger.WithCollectorEndpoint(jaeger.WithEndpoint("http://jaeger-collector:14268/api/traces")),
        jaeger.WithProcess(jaeger.Process{
            ServiceName: "document-service",
            Tags: []label.KeyValue{
                label.String("environment", os.Getenv("ENVIRONMENT")),
            },
        }),
    )
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("Failed to create Jaeger exporter: %v", err)
    }
    
    tp := trace.NewTracerProvider(
        trace.WithBatcher(exporter),
        trace.WithSampler(trace.TraceIDRatioBased(0.1)),
    )
    
    otel.SetTracerProvider(tp)
    otel.SetTextMapPropagator(propagation.NewCompositeTextMapPropagator(
        propagation.TraceContext{},
        propagation.Baggage{},
    ))
    
    return tp.Tracer("document-service")
}

func tracingMiddleware(next http.Handler) http.Handler {
    return http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
        ctx := r.Context()
        propagator := otel.GetTextMapPropagator()
        ctx = propagator.Extract(ctx, propagation.HeaderCarrier(r.Header))
        
        tracer := otel.Tracer("document-service")
        ctx, span := tracer.Start(ctx, r.URL.Path, trace.WithSpanKind(trace.SpanKindServer))
        defer span.End()
        
        span.SetAttributes(
            attribute.String("http.method", r.Method),
            attribute.String("http.url", r.URL.String()),
            attribute.String("http.user_agent", r.UserAgent()),
        )
        
        // Extract tenant ID from context and add to span
        if tenantID := ctx.Value("tenant_id"); tenantID != nil {
            span.SetAttributes(attribute.String("tenant_id", tenantID.(string)))
        }
        
        // Serve the request with the trace context
        next.ServeHTTP(w, r.WithContext(ctx))
    })
}
```

### Trace Analysis

Traces are analyzed using the Jaeger UI, which provides the following capabilities:

- **Trace Timeline**: Visual representation of spans and their timing
- **Service Dependencies**: Graph of service interactions
- **Span Details**: Detailed information about each span
- **Trace Comparison**: Compare traces to identify performance differences

Trace analysis is used for performance troubleshooting, identifying bottlenecks, and understanding service dependencies.

## Alerting

The Document Management Platform implements a comprehensive alerting system to ensure timely notification of critical issues. Alerts are defined based on metrics, logs, and traces to provide complete coverage of potential issues.

### Alert Rules

Alert rules are defined in Prometheus using PromQL expressions. The rules cover the following categories:

- **Service Availability**: Alerts for service downtime or unreachability
- **Performance**: Alerts for high response times or latency
- **Error Rates**: Alerts for elevated error rates
- **Resource Utilization**: Alerts for high CPU, memory, or disk usage
- **Business Metrics**: Alerts for abnormal business metrics
- **Security**: Alerts for security-related events

Each alert includes appropriate thresholds, evaluation periods, and severity levels.

```yaml
groups:
- name: service_availability
  rules:
  - alert: ServiceDown
    expr: up{job=~"document-service|storage-service|search-service|folder-service|virus-scanning-service"} == 0
    for: 1m
    labels:
      severity: critical
    annotations:
      summary: "Service {{ $labels.job }} is down"
      description: "Service {{ $labels.job }} in namespace {{ $labels.namespace }} has been down for more than 1 minute."
      dashboard: "https://grafana.document-mgmt.com/d/api-dashboard"
      runbook: "https://runbooks.document-mgmt.com/service-down"

- name: api_performance
  rules:
  - alert: APIHighResponseTime
    expr: histogram_quantile(0.95, sum(rate(http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{job=~"document-service|storage-service|search-service|folder-service"}[5m])) by (job, le)) > 2
    for: 5m
    labels:
      severity: high
    annotations:
      summary: "High API response time for {{ $labels.job }}"
      description: "95th percentile response time for {{ $labels.job }} is above 2 seconds for more than 5 minutes."
      dashboard: "https://grafana.document-mgmt.com/d/api-dashboard"
      runbook: "https://runbooks.document-mgmt.com/high-response-time"

- name: sla_compliance
  rules:
  - alert: APIResponseTimeSLABreach
    expr: histogram_quantile(0.99, sum(rate(http_request_duration_seconds_bucket[1h])) by (le)) > 2
    for: 5m
    labels:
      severity: critical
    annotations:
      summary: "API response time SLA breach"
      description: "99th percentile API response time is above 2 seconds for more than 5 minutes, breaching the SLA."
      dashboard: "https://grafana.document-mgmt.com/d/sla-dashboard"
      runbook: "https://runbooks.document-mgmt.com/sla-breach-response-time"
```

### Alert Routing

Alerts are routed to appropriate notification channels using AlertManager. The routing configuration includes:

- **Severity-Based Routing**: Different channels based on alert severity
- **Team-Based Routing**: Routing to specialized teams for specific alert types
- **Time-Based Routing**: Different routing during business hours vs. off-hours
- **Escalation**: Automatic escalation for unacknowledged alerts

This ensures that alerts reach the right people at the right time for prompt resolution.

```yaml
global:
  resolve_timeout: 5m
  smtp_smarthost: "smtp.example.com:587"
  smtp_from: "alertmanager@document-mgmt.com"
  smtp_auth_username: "alertmanager"
  smtp_auth_password: "${SMTP_PASSWORD}"
  smtp_require_tls: true
  pagerduty_url: "https://events.pagerduty.com/v2/enqueue"
  slack_api_url: "${SLACK_API_URL}"

route:
  receiver: operations-team
  group_by: [alertname, job, severity]
  group_wait: 30s

    receiver: database-team
    group_wait: 30s
    group_interval: 5m
    repeat_interval: 1h
    continue: true
```

### Notification Channels

Alerts are sent to the following notification channels:

- **PagerDuty**: For critical and high-severity alerts requiring immediate attention
- **Slack**: For team-specific channels and general alerts

## Incident Response

The Document Management Platform implements a structured incident response process to ensure timely resolution of issues. This process is integrated with the monitoring and alerting system to provide a seamless workflow from detection to resolution.

### Alert Response Workflow

The alert response workflow follows these steps:

1. **Detection**: Alert triggered based on monitoring thresholds
2. **Notification**: Alert routed to appropriate team/individual
3. **Acknowledgment**: Responder acknowledges the alert
4. **Investigation**: Responder investigates the issue using monitoring tools
5. **Mitigation**: Immediate actions to mitigate the impact
6. **Resolution**: Permanent fix for the issue
7. **Post-mortem**: Analysis of the incident and improvement actions

This workflow ensures a consistent and effective response to all incidents.

### Incident Severity Levels

Incidents are classified into the following severity levels:

- **P1 (Critical)**: Service outage or severe degradation affecting all users
- **P2 (High)**: Partial service degradation affecting some users or functionality
- **P3 (Medium)**: Minor issues with limited impact on users
- **P4 (Low)**: Cosmetic issues or improvements

Each severity level has associated response times, escalation procedures, and communication requirements.

| Severity | Description | Response Time | Escalation Path | Communication |
| -------- | ----------- | ------------- | --------------- | ------------- |
| P1 | Service outage or severe degradation | Immediate | On-call → Team Lead → Engineering Manager → CTO | Status page, all stakeholders |
| P2 | Partial service degradation | 30 minutes | On-call → Team Lead → Engineering Manager | Status page, affected stakeholders |
| P3 | Minor issues with limited impact | 2 hours | On-call → Team Lead | Internal notification |
| P4 | Cosmetic issues or improvements | Next business day | Standard ticket | None |

### Escalation Procedures

The escalation procedures ensure that incidents receive appropriate attention based on their severity and duration. The escalation path typically follows:

1. **Primary On-Call**: Initial responder for all alerts
2. **Secondary On-Call**: Escalated if primary doesn't respond within 15 minutes
3. **Team Lead**: Escalated for P1/P2 incidents lasting more than 30 minutes
4. **Engineering Manager**: Escalated for P1 incidents lasting more than 1 hour
5. **CTO**: Escalated for P1 incidents lasting more than 2 hours

Escalation can also be manually triggered if additional expertise or authority is required.

| -------- | --------------- | ------------------ | --------------- |
| Storage | Usage growth rate, available space | Linear regression | 70% utilization |
| Compute | CPU/memory trends, request volume | Time-series analysis | 75% sustained utilization |
| Database | Connection count, query volume, storage | Growth pattern analysis | 70% utilization |
| Network | Bandwidth usage, request rate | Peak analysis | 60% of capacity |

### Scaling Policies

Scaling policies define when and how resources are scaled based on monitoring data. Policies include:

- **Horizontal Scaling**: Adding more instances of services
- **Vertical Scaling**: Increasing resources for existing instances
- **Storage Scaling**: Expanding storage capacity
- **Database Scaling**: Scaling database resources

Scaling can be automatic (based on monitoring triggers) or planned (based on forecasts).

```yaml
# Example Kubernetes HPA configuration
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler

        periodSeconds: 60
```

### Capacity Reviews

Regular capacity reviews ensure that resources are appropriately provisioned. Reviews include:

- **Current Utilization**: Analysis of current resource usage
- **Growth Trends**: Review of growth patterns and forecasts
- **Performance Impact**: Assessment of performance metrics
- **Cost Analysis**: Evaluation of resource costs and optimization opportunities
- **Scaling Recommendations**: Specific recommendations for scaling actions

Capacity reviews are conducted monthly with participation from operations and engineering teams.

## Monitoring Best Practices

The Document Management Platform follows established monitoring best practices to ensure effective observability and incident response.

### Instrumentation Guidelines

All services follow these instrumentation guidelines:

- **Consistent Metrics**: Standardized naming and labeling conventions
- **Appropriate Granularity**: Sufficient detail without excessive cardinality
- **Performance Impact**: Minimal overhead from instrumentation
- **Coverage**: Comprehensive instrumentation of all critical paths
- **Context Propagation**: Consistent propagation of request context

These guidelines ensure that monitoring data is consistent, comprehensive, and useful for troubleshooting.

```go
// Example of metrics naming and labeling conventions

// Metric naming convention: service_subsystem_metric_unit
// Examples:
// - http_requests_total (counter)  
// - http_request_duration_seconds (histogram)
// - document_processing_duration_seconds (histogram)
// - document_size_bytes (histogram)

// Label naming convention: snake_case
// Common labels:
// - service: Service name
// - namespace: Kubernetes namespace
// - instance: Instance identifier
// - tenant_id: Tenant identifier
// - status: HTTP status code or operation status
// - method: HTTP method
// - endpoint: API endpoint

// Cardinality guidelines:
// - Keep label values bounded (e.g., use status code families like 2xx instead of individual codes)
// - Avoid using high-cardinality labels like user_id or document_id in metrics
// - Use bucketing for histograms with appropriate bucket boundaries
```

### Alert Design Principles

Alerts follow these design principles:

- **Actionability**: Every alert should be actionable
- **Clarity**: Clear description of the issue and required actions
- **Precision**: Minimize false positives and alert fatigue
- **Prioritization**: Appropriate severity levels for different issues
- **Context**: Include relevant context for troubleshooting

These principles ensure that alerts are effective and lead to prompt resolution of issues.

| Principle | Good Example | Bad Example |
| --------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| Actionability | "Document service pod crash looping - check logs and recent deployments" | "Document service issue detected" |
| Clarity | "API response time > 2s for search endpoint - check Elasticsearch performance" | "High latency detected" |
| Precision | Alert on 95th percentile > threshold for 5 minutes | Alert on any single request > threshold |
| Prioritization | Critical severity for service outage, medium for performance degradation | Same severity for all issues |
| Context | Include links to dashboards, logs, and runbooks | No additional context provided |

### Dashboard Design Guidelines

Dashboards follow these design guidelines:

- **Purpose-Oriented**: Focused on specific use cases or audiences
- **Hierarchical Information**: Overview with drill-down capabilities
- **Visual Clarity**: Clear visualization of key metrics and status
- **Consistency**: Similar metrics positioned consistently across dashboards
- **Performance**: Efficient queries that don't overload monitoring systems

These guidelines ensure that dashboards are intuitive and provide quick access to relevant information.

### Monitoring as Code

The monitoring configuration follows the "Monitoring as Code" approach with the following practices:

- **Version Control**: All monitoring configurations in Git
- **Automated Deployment**: CI/CD pipeline for monitoring changes
- **Testing**: Validation of monitoring configurations before deployment
- **Documentation**: Inline documentation of monitoring components
- **Reusability**: Templated configurations for consistent monitoring

This approach ensures that monitoring configurations are consistent, reproducible, and properly managed.

```yaml
# Example of Prometheus alert rule template
{{ define "node_alerts" }}
groups:
- name: node_alerts
  rules:
  - alert: NodeHighCPU
    expr: avg by (instance) (rate(node_cpu_seconds_total{mode!="idle"}[5m])) > {{ .Values.thresholds.node.cpu }}
    for: 5m
    labels:
      severity: {{ .Values.severities.node.cpu }}
    annotations:
      summary: "High CPU usage on {{ "{{" }} $labels.instance {{ "}}" }}"
      description: "CPU usage on {{ "{{" }} $labels.instance {{ "}}" }} has been above {{ .Values.thresholds.node.cpu }} for more than 5 minutes."
      dashboard: "{{ .Values.dashboards.node }}"
      runbook: "{{ .Values.runbooks.node_high_cpu }}"
  
  - alert: NodeHighMemory
    expr: (node_memory_MemTotal_bytes - node_memory_MemAvailable_bytes) / node_memory_MemTotal_bytes > {{ .Values.thresholds.node.memory }}
    for: 5m
    labels:
      severity: {{ .Values.severities.node.memory }}
    annotations:
      summary: "High memory usage on {{ "{{" }} $labels.instance {{ "}}" }}"
      description: "Memory usage on {{ "{{" }} $labels.instance {{ "}}" }} has been above {{ .Values.thresholds.node.memory }} for more than 5 minutes."
      dashboard: "{{ .Values.dashboards.node }}"
      runbook: "{{ .Values.runbooks.node_high_memory }}"
{{ end }}
```

## Monitoring Setup Guide

This section provides practical guidance for setting up and configuring the monitoring system for the Document Management Platform.

### Initial Setup

To set up the monitoring infrastructure, follow these steps:

1. **Deploy Monitoring Stack**: Use Helm charts to deploy Prometheus, Grafana, Elasticsearch, Fluent Bit, and Jaeger
2. **Configure Service Discovery**: Set up Kubernetes service discovery for automatic monitoring of services
3. **Import Dashboards**: Import pre-configured dashboards for different services
4. **Configure Alerting**: Set up AlertManager and notification channels
5. **Validate Setup**: Verify that all components are working correctly

Detailed instructions for each step are provided in the deployment documentation.

```bash
# Example commands for deploying the monitoring stack

# Add Helm repositories

kubectl get pods -n monitoring
```

### Service Instrumentation

To instrument services for monitoring, follow these guidelines:

1. **Metrics Instrumentation**: Add Prometheus client libraries and expose metrics endpoints
2. **Logging Configuration**: Configure structured logging with appropriate fields
3. **Tracing Instrumentation**: Add OpenTelemetry instrumentation for distributed tracing
4. **Health Checks**: Implement health check endpoints for liveness and readiness probes
5. **Custom Metrics**: Add service-specific metrics for business operations

Example code snippets and configuration files are provided for each language and framework used in the platform.

```go
// Example of service instrumentation in Go

// main.go
func main() {
    // Initialize logger
    logger := initLogger()
    defer logger.Sync()
    
    // Initialize metrics
    initMetrics()
    
    // Initialize tracer
    tracer := initTracer()
    defer tracer.Shutdown(context.Background())
    
    // Create router with instrumentation
    router := gin.New()
    router.Use(ginzap.Ginzap(logger, time.RFC3339, true))
    router.Use(ginzap.RecoveryWithZap(logger, true))
    router.Use(prometheusMiddleware())
    router.Use(tracingMiddleware())
    
    // Add health check endpoints
    router.GET("/health/liveness", livenessHandler)
    router.GET("/health/readiness", readinessHandler)
    
    // Add metrics endpoint
    router.GET("/metrics", gin.WrapH(promhttp.Handler()))
    
    // Configure API routes
    configureRoutes(router)
    
    // Start server
    srv := &http.Server{
        Addr:    ":8080",
        Handler: router,
    }
    
    logger.Info("Starting server on :8080")
    if err := srv.ListenAndServe(); err != nil && err != http.ErrServerClosed {
        logger.Fatal("Failed to start server", zap.Error(err))
    }
}

// Prometheus middleware for request metrics
func prometheusMiddleware() gin.HandlerFunc {
    return func(c *gin.Context) {
        start := time.Now()
        path := c.FullPath()
        if path == "" {
            path = "unknown"
        }
        
        c.Next()
        
        status := strconv.Itoa(c.Writer.Status())
        elapsed := time.Since(start).Seconds()
        
        requestCounter.WithLabelValues(c.Request.Method, path, status).Inc()
        requestDuration.WithLabelValues(c.Request.Method, path).Observe(elapsed)
    }
}
```

### Alert Configuration

To configure alerts for the platform, follow these steps:

1. **Define Alert Rules**: Create Prometheus alert rules for different services
2. **Configure AlertManager**: Set up routing and notification channels
3. **Create Notification Templates**: Customize alert notifications for different channels
4. **Test Alerts**: Verify that alerts are triggered and routed correctly
5. **Document Runbooks**: Create runbooks for each alert type

Alert configurations should be managed as code and deployed through the CI/CD pipeline.

```yaml
# Example alert rules for document service
groups:
- name: document_service_alerts
  rules:
  - alert: DocumentServiceDown
    expr: up{job="document-service"} == 0
    for: 1m
    labels:
      severity: critical
    annotations:
      summary: "Document Service is down"
      description: "Document Service has been down for more than 1 minute."
      dashboard: "https://grafana.document-mgmt.com/d/document-service-dashboard"
      runbook: "https://runbooks.document-mgmt.com/document-service-down"
  
  - alert: DocumentProcessingDelay
    expr: histogram_quantile(0.95, sum(rate(document_processing_duration_seconds_bucket[5m])) by (le)) > 300
    for: 5m
    labels:
      severity: high
    annotations:
      summary: "Document processing delay detected"
      description: "95th percentile document processing time is above 5 minutes (300 seconds) for more than 5 minutes."
      dashboard: "https://grafana.document-mgmt.com/d/document-service-dashboard"
      runbook: "https://runbooks.document-mgmt.com/document-processing-delay"
  
  - alert: DocumentProcessingQueueBacklog
    expr: sum(aws_sqs_approximate_number_of_messages_visible{queue_name=~".*document.*|.*virus.*"}) > 100
    for: 15m
    labels:
      severity: high
    annotations:
      summary: "Document processing queue backlog"
      description: "Document processing queue has more than 100 messages for more than 15 minutes."
      dashboard: "https://grafana.document-mgmt.com/d/document-service-dashboard"
      runbook: "https://runbooks.document-mgmt.com/queue-backlog"
```

### Dashboard Creation

To create effective dashboards for the platform, follow these steps:

1. **Identify Audience**: Determine the target audience and their needs
2. **Select Metrics**: Choose relevant metrics for the dashboard purpose
3. **Design Layout**: Organize panels in a logical and intuitive layout
4. **Add Context**: Include helpful descriptions and documentation
5. **Test Usability**: Verify that the dashboard is intuitive and useful

Dashboards should be exported as JSON and managed in version control for consistency and reproducibility.

## Troubleshooting Guide

This section provides guidance for troubleshooting common monitoring issues in the Document Management Platform.

### Monitoring System Issues

Common issues with the monitoring system itself and how to resolve them:

1. **Prometheus Not Scraping Metrics**: Check service discovery configuration, network connectivity, and target endpoints
2. **Alertmanager Not Sending Notifications**: Verify alertmanager configuration, notification channel settings, and network connectivity
3. **Grafana Dashboard Errors**: Check data source configuration, query syntax, and panel settings
4. **Log Collection Issues**: Verify fluent-bit configuration, elasticsearch connectivity, and log parsing rules
5. **Tracing Collection Issues**: Check jaeger configuration, instrumentation, and sampling settings

Troubleshooting steps and commands are provided for each issue type.

```bash
# Troubleshooting Prometheus scraping issues

# Check Prometheus configuration
kubectl get configmap prometheus-server -n monitoring -o yaml

# Check Prometheus logs
kubectl logs deployment/prometheus-server -n monitoring

# Check service discovery status
kubectl port-forward svc/prometheus-server 9090:9090 -n monitoring
# Then open http://localhost:9090/service-discovery in browser

# Check target status
kubectl port-forward svc/prometheus-server 9090:9090 -n monitoring
# Then open http://localhost:9090/targets in browser

# Check if metrics endpoint is accessible
kubectl port-forward svc/document-service 8080:8080 -n document-mgmt-prod
curl http://localhost:8080/metrics
```

### Common Alert Troubleshooting

Guidance for troubleshooting common alert types:

1. **Service Down Alerts**: Check pod status, logs, and recent deployments
2. **High Response Time Alerts**: Check service logs, database performance, and resource utilization
3. **Error Rate Alerts**: Check service logs for error patterns and recent changes
4. **Resource Utilization Alerts**: Check resource usage patterns and scaling configuration
5. **Queue Backlog Alerts**: Check consumer service status and processing rate

Troubleshooting steps and commands are provided for each alert type.

```bash
# Troubleshooting Service Down alerts

# Check pod status
kubectl get pods -n document-mgmt-prod | grep document-service

# Check pod details
kubectl describe pod <pod-name> -n document-mgmt-prod

# Check container logs
kubectl logs <pod-name> -n document-mgmt-prod

# Check recent deployments
kubectl rollout history deployment/document-service -n document-mgmt-prod

# Check events
kubectl get events -n document-mgmt-prod --sort-by='.lastTimestamp'

# Check service endpoints
kubectl get endpoints document-service -n document-mgmt-prod

# Check if service is responding to health checks
kubectl port-forward svc/document-service 8080:8080 -n document-mgmt-prod
curl http://localhost:8080/health/liveness
curl http://localhost:8080/health/readiness
```

### Performance Analysis

Techniques for analyzing performance issues using monitoring data:

1. **Response Time Analysis**: Use percentile metrics and tracing to identify slow components
2. **Resource Bottleneck Identification**: Correlate CPU, memory, and I/O metrics with performance
3. **Database Query Analysis**: Use slow query logs and execution plans
4. **Network Performance Analysis**: Check latency, throughput, and error rates
5. **Concurrency Analysis**: Identify contention points and thread pool saturation

Example queries and visualization techniques are provided for each analysis type.

```promql
# PromQL queries for performance analysis

# Response time by service (p95)
histogram_quantile(0.95, sum(rate(http_request_duration_seconds_bucket[5m])) by (job, le))

# Response time by endpoint (p95)
histogram_quantile(0.95, sum(rate(http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{handler!=""}[5m])) by (handler, le))

# Error rate by service
sum(rate(http_requests_total{status=~"5.."}[5m])) by (job) / sum(rate(http_requests_total[5m])) by (job)

# CPU usage by pod
sum(rate(container_cpu_usage_seconds_total{container!="", container!="POD"}[5m])) by (pod, namespace) / sum(kube_pod_container_resource_limits{resource="cpu"}) by (pod, namespace)

# Memory usage by pod
sum(container_memory_usage_bytes{container!="", container!="POD"}) by (pod, namespace) / sum(kube_pod_container_resource_limits{resource="memory"}) by (pod, namespace)

# Document processing time (p95)
histogram_quantile(0.95, sum(rate(document_processing_duration_seconds_bucket[5m])) by (le))

# Processing queue depth
sum(aws_sqs_approximate_number_of_messages_visible{queue_name=~".*document.*|.*virus.*"})

# Database connections
sum(pg_stat_activity_count) by (instance)
```

### Log Analysis Techniques

Effective techniques for analyzing logs to troubleshoot issues:

1. **Structured Query Language**: Using Elasticsearch Query DSL for log analysis
2. **Log Correlation**: Correlating logs across services using trace IDs and request IDs
3. **Pattern Recognition**: Identifying error patterns and anomalies
4. **Time-based Analysis**: Analyzing logs around specific time periods
5. **Context Extraction**: Extracting relevant context from log entries

Example queries and analysis workflows are provided for common troubleshooting scenarios.

```json
